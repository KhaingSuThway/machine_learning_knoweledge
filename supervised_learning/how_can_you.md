In this folder, I will cover some basic ML models related to supervised learning.

### 1.Linear Regression
Regression is a type of supervised learning problem, where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value from some input variables.
Finding a relationship between two case like " From farenheit to celsius".This is a simple and widely used algorithm that assumes a linear relationship between the input and output variables. It tries to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the error between the predicted and actual values. For example, the equation that relates Fahrenheit and Celsius is a linear regression model with a slope of 5/9â€‹ and an intercept of -160/9.
Some examples of real life problems that can be solved using a simple basic linear regression model are:
    How does advertising spending affect revenue for a business?1
    How does drug dosage affect blood pressure for patients?2
    How does fertilizer and water affect crop yields for farmers?3
    How does income affect happiness for individuals?
