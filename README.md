This repository contains basic concepts and programs related to machine learning. I have tested and explained these concepts based on my understanding and what I have learned.


### What is machine learning?
Do you know the Disney cartoon Tarzan? Of course, you do! Do you remember when Jane taught Tarzan the names of different things in the jungle? Well, we are doing something similar when we teach our machines (computers, mobile phones, IoT devices) using machine learning. We are like Jane and the machines are like Tarzan. ðŸŒ´

In machine learning, there are different ways of teaching the machines. Here are some of them:

##### Supervised learning: 
We supervise our machines by giving them labeled data. For example, we can show them pictures of cats and dogs and tell them which is which. Then, the machines can learn to recognize cats and dogs on their own. 

##### Unsupervised learning: 
We let our machines discover patterns and features from unlabeled data. For example, we can give them a bunch of customer reviews and let them find out the common topics and sentiments. Then, the machines can learn to analyze customer feedback on their own.

##### Reinforcement learning: 
We reward our machines for performing well and punish them for performing poorly. For example, we can teach them to play a game and give them points for winning and take away points for losing. Then, the machines can learn to play the game better on their own. 

These are just some of the types of machine learning. There are many more concepts and techniques that you can explore in this repository. I hope you find them useful and interesting. Happy learning!
